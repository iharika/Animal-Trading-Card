			<p>Puffins are open sea birds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs
				or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil.Their short wings are adapted for swimming
				with a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean's surface.</p>
